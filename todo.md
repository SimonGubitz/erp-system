    - all power in the json????

✓ In the Table, with Arrays add the buttons to "scroll" though the Arrays
    - In all implementations of this ↑, make the arrow gray out, when at the max of each array


- Finish the Layout.jsx
- Finish the createValidJson.ts


- Fix, that there are multiple ContextMenus, for each column one, and then if extended even for each cell one
    - Maybe add a ContextMenuGroup, in which only ever one may exist

    - When clicking inside an ContextMenu and NOT on an option, the ContextMenu will popup again at that position
    - When left clicking anywhere, when a ContextMenu is opened, will open it again at the same position.
